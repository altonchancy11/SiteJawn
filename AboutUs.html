        <p>â€‹In a midlife crisis, I found myself in the desert at Burning Man. On the second day in a drunken mania, I wandered out into the Nevada dunes. I was lost for two days and in that time I encountered a few dehydration-induced hallucinations. As I was cooking in the sun, I saw burgers sizzling beside me. Those visions gave me the spirit to wander back to the encampment and the inspiration to create the world's greatest B-health rating "burger" spot.</br></p></br>

        <p>I had never really been able to cook, so I pretty much fumbled my way to a couple half-decent burger "recipes". I drew inspiration from my public school cafeteria lunches which is why all my "burgers" are cooked to a perfect well-done grey.</p>
